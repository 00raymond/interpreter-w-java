generating interference graph for loops:
- start empty live set, work UP in the program

______________
     | x and a must be alive prior to phi function, - {i,j}, + {x,a}
---------------
i : phi(x,y) BB1
j : phi(a,b)
live2 {
live 1 {
live 3 + live 1
 |          \
 |           \
 |   follow   \
 |             \
 |
 |
--------
       |
-------- <= live 2

3  nested loops for implementation
- 2 iterations, 1st sweeps up the live values, 2nd makes sure they all interfere
-

removal of phi:

for all phi instructions: x = phi(y.. y2...)
 cluster = {x}
 for all y_i that are not constant do
  cluster = cluster U {y_i}
    if yi does not interfere with cluster then
        replace x with y_i
        remove phi instruction
        breakadd yi and its edges to cluster, remove yi from graph
replace x by cluster
